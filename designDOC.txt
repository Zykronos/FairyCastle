Medieval -> Steampunk -> Cyberpunk 
Anglo-Saxon / Norse / Roman / Egyptian history / lore mixed with magic 
Inspirations: 
    Dwarf Fortress, Civilization, Runescape, Megaman 
    Dwarf Fortress 
        Roguelike mode 
        Castle mode 
    Civilization 
        In Castle mode, each civ will have one settlement, similar to DF's Castle mode 
        Settlements will eventually have to expand 
        Civs can send out settlers to found to settlements, expanding their empire 
        Can build trade routes between civs 
    Runescape 
        Each individual character has different skills: 
            Mining 
                Used to gather stone, different metals for melee equipment and arrow tips, and rune stones for runecrafting 
                Tier 1 = Copper, Stone 
                Tier 2 = Iron 
                Tier 3 = Steel 
                Tier 4 = Mithril 
                Tier 5 = Adamantium, Obsidian 
            Smithing 
                Used to craft melee weapons, plate armors, chain shirts, and arrow tips 
                Tier 1 = Copper 
                Tier 2 = Iron 
                Tier 3 = Steel 
                Tier 4 = Mithril 
                Tier 5 = Adamantium 
            Farming 
                Tier 1 = Potatoes 
                Tier 2 = Flax 
            Crafting 
            Fishing 
            Cooking 
            Woodcutting 
                Used to gather wood for archery equipment, wands, and other crafting items 
                Tier 1 = Logs 
                Tier 2 = Oak 
            Fletching 
                Used to craft archery equipment and wands 
                Tier 1 = Copper Arrows, Log Bow 
                Tier 2 = Iron Arrows, Oak Bow 
                Tier 3 = Steel Arrows 
                Tier 4 = Mithril Arrows 
                Tier 5 = Adamantium Arrows 
            Melee 
                Determines melee accuracy and tier of melee equipment that can be used 
            Archery 
                Determines ranged accuracy and tier of archery equipment that can be used 
            Magic 
                Runestones possibly made from conductive materials that medieval people don't completely understand, but can eventually be used to create computer chips or similar 
                Determines tier of spell that can be used 
                Tier 1 = Bolt spells (single target) 
                Tier 2 = Ball spells (small aoe) 
                Tier 3 = Cloud spells (persistent aoe) 
                Attaching a specific runestone to a wand allows a limited number of casts of the specific spell before the wand breaks down and must be replaced 
                Higher tier spells get fewer casts per wand 
                All equipment can be enchanted with various runes, giving different effects 
                    Swords and arrows enchanted with elemental runes deal elemental damage and can cast special abilities 
                    Gauntlets can be enchanted to work as weaker, longer lasting wands 
                        Enchanted gauntlets can be used to temporarily enchant equipped weapons and cast simple attack spells 
                    Other equipment (helm, chest, legs, boots, shield, bow) get other abilities 
                        e.g. A helm enchanted with lightning gives increases vision range, boots enchanted with lightning give increased move speed, etc. 
                Summoning 
                    Beasts of burden, temporary peasants 
                    Requires a rune stone attached to a vessel, which attracts fairies / spirits / valkyries to control the construct 
                Shapeshifting? 
                Different elements give penalties to the caster while buffing the caster's ability in that element 
                    Fire 
                        As player casts fire spells, they build up stacks of heat 
                        As heat stacks, the player moves faster and deals more fire damage 
                        At max stacks, the caster is lit on fire, taking heavy dot 
                    Ice 
                        Similar to fire, the caster stacks chill 
                        Chill causes the caster to move slower, deal more ice damage, and causes enemies in range to move slower 
                        At max stacks, the player is frozen, completely immobilized and resistant to some types of damage 
                    Lightning 
                    Earth 
                    Life 

            Runecrafting 
                Used to craft runestones used to enchant equipment and attach to vessels for summoning 
                Basic runestones can be used to give minor, permanent buffs to equipment 
                Obsidian runestones can be used to stronger, temporary buffs 

        Characters unlock new crafting items by increasing their levels 
            e.g. Farming level 1 for potatoes, Farming level 5 for wheat, etc. 
    Megaman 
        In Adventure mode, the game world will consist of various 'levels' connected to each other through locked doors 
        Player must defeat bosses to unlock certain doors and progress through the game 
        Defeating bosses unlocks special powers 
        Boss order possibly nonlinear 
            i.e. player can fight bosses in any order, but must defeat all of them before moving on to the final gauntlet ('Sigma stages') 
Tiles-as-objects: 
    Every tile, from the floor to the player to item pickups, is its own object 
    Basic tile attributes include location, sprite, layer, walkability 
    Basic tile methods include draw 
Unity-style layering:  
    'ground' layer, including the floor and walls 
    'actor' layer, including the player and enemies 
    Each tile given a layer, then drawn according to its layer 
        e.g. 'actors' drawn in front of 'ground' 
Game Modes: 
    Campaign and Castle modes will use Runescape-style skills, while Roguelike mode will be more traditionally class-based (e.g. Warrior, Mage, Thief, etc.) 
    Campaign Mode: 
        Story-based, nonrandomized open-world campain 
        Game board is split into different 'levels'; large areas ending with a boss fight 
            Each level is connected to the others, so players can go through levels and fight bosses in a nonlinear way 
    Roguelike Mode: 
        Randomized levels connect to the others through stairs 
        One life; player must restart from the beginning when they die 
    Castle Mode: 
        Dwarf Fortress style strategy game 
        Player controls various units and must build up their city, building workshops, farms, and other buildings 
        Eventual intention to be more like Civilization, where the player creates an empire rather than a singular castle
